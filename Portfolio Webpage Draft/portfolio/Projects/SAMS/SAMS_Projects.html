                    This was our first project for the course and an introduction to Web Design with HTML and CSS.
                    Our goal was to recreate a fake resume that was on Andrew Carnegie. I mainly used CSS to style
                    the webpage.

                    Another one of our projects was SAMS-tagarm where we created different boxes that looked like they
                    were a post from a social media site. The most difficult aspect of this assignment was creating
                    a blank div that had no elements within it but still displayed on the page.
                </p>
                <!--Image displayed-->
                <div class="image_container">

                <!--Information about the Project-->
                <p>
                    We later improved on the on SAMS-tagram 1.0 by adding the ability for you to add and delete different
                    post using JAVAscript. You could add different images by inserting an image URL and typing a caption
                    that would be placed beneath the inserted image. If the caption overflowed the Post, the text would
                    wrap inside the div and you could scroll down to see more of the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also linked a Profile page to the home page where it
                    displayed information about Andrew Carnegie. Below the original text was a form where you could input
                    new information that would replace the original one. However, whenever you reloaded the page the
                    inputed information was not saved. Another issue was that when you did not input any information into
                    the form it set the bio information to blank.

                <h1>SAMS-tagram 3.0</h1>
                <!--Information about the Project-->
                <p>
                    For SAMS-tagram 3.0 we connected both HTML pages to Google Firebase. For the News Feed I used a similar
                    design as the TODO List by creating a new collection cost Post saving the input values into unique and
                    computer-generated documents. To delete a post I just got the doc id from the database and deleted the
                    particular document and removed it from the HTML page. When you reload the page the earlier posts display
                    using query Snapshots to get each document from the collection and add the values to the Post div.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The profile page used a different design because I named the document amin_profile and each type you input
                    text into the form it would set the values of main_profile to be the input value. This method was needed
                    because I wasn't creating a new document each time I type in the text but rather calling upon one document
                    and changing the information. Also when I reload the page I couldn't have multiple documents display
                    but I just needed the information in that one document to be displayed.

                    Moodboard was an assignment based mainly on Javascript. Whenever you input an image URL it would
                    display it on the screen. When you got to the edge of the page it would wrap around and start a new
                    line with the images.

                    This was our first basic game using JAVAscript, HTML and a little CSS. Within the JAVAscript file
                    you had an array with a list of 20 words. Every 3 seconds a random word would be selected and
                    displayed on the page at a random location. At the top of the page, you had a form where you could
                    type the words that were displayed on the page. By using an if statement we were able to cross-reference
                    whether the typed value matched any of the values displayed on the page and if it was true
                    the word was removed. The objective of the game was to constantly keep the page clear of any words.
                    One issue I faced was that the words would sometimes display outside the viewable screen
                    and you would have to scroll either down or to the right to see the word.

                    For this assignment, we used JAVAScript to create a form and CSS to make it look like a Post-it note.
                    I then added the ability to type text into the Post-it note and when you clicked enter it would display
                    the Post-it note with the written text in rows below the form. You could add multiple Post-it notes
                    and when you clicked on a Post-it note it would delete it.

                    This was our first introduction to back-end development. We improved on TODO List by connecting the javascript
                    to Google firebase. We then created a collection called notes and each time you saved a sticky note to the
                    page it would save the input value to the collection under a random and unique document name. If you wanted to
                    delete a post we add an event Listener that would delete the post form the screen but also remove it from the
                    database using the unique id. Initially, when you reloaded the page it did not save the post but when I
                    included the document ready function I was able to get each document that had been typed in the collection and
                    display it on the page
